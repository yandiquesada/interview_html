           Challenge 1           
==================================

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the iTH line are (i, 0) and
(i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.


Consider the following example:

      y-axis   
       |  
       |
   8   |      |                   |
   7   |      |                   |       |
   6   |      |   |               |       |
   5   |      |   |       |       |       |
   4   |      |   |       |   |   |       |
   3   |      |   |       |   |   |   |   |
   2   |      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   1   |__|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|__________ x-axis
   0          VL1                        VL2 

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
In this case, the max area of water (between VL1 and VL2) the container can contain is 49.

Consider the following code to complete your solution.

// Kotlin 
class Solution {
    
    fun maxArea(height: IntArray): Int {
        //TODO: add code here
    }
}

// Java 
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        //TODO: add code here
    }
}

           Challenge 2           
==================================

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 

Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. 
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Example: 
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

// Consider to use the following java or kotlin code to implement the node
// Do not modify the linked list

/** Kotlin *******************************
 * Example:
 * var li = ListNode(5)
 * var v = li.`val`
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode(var `val`: Int) {
 *     var next: ListNode? = null
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    fun detectCycle(head: ListNode?): ListNode? {
           //TODO: add code here       
    }
}

/** JAVA **********************************
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */

public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        //TODO: add code here
    }
}

==================================
           Challenge 3           
==================================


Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words, return the most frequent word that is not banned. 
It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.

The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

Constraints:

1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000
paragraph consists of English letters, space ' ', or one of the symbols: "!?',;.".
0 <= banned.length <= 100
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10
banned[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.


Example 1:

Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.", banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
